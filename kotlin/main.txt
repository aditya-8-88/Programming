KOTLIN IS A COMBINATION OF SEVERAL GOOD THINGS IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES;





// ; are not used like in python
/*
    lets say
    var x= "hello word"
    x=23// ERROR here now x can't be int once it had a string value and this senerio applies to all the things
        // but in PYTHON you can do so
*/
// kotlin has a data type named UNIT --> none datatype ; ANY --> all type of data can be entered here
// we can use function inside a function orr to say we can use function as variable







var & val 
var name : String?= null     //declares a name variable which is string and has a default value null
switch() --> when()
